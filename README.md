Who is behind this
------------------
For now this is being developed by Sumit Datta ([brainless](https://github.com/brainless)). Feel free to contribute. This project is in very early stages and I have not had to time to write a guide to easily setup an environment. So if you are familiar with Python, then you can easily go ahead. If not, kindly search for `virtualenv`, `pip`, `django`. You will easily find instructions to setup projects. I will write a guide soon. You are welcome to follow (Watch/Star) the project. Thanks.
